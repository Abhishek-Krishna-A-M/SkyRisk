# SkyRisk ‚Äì Weather Risk Predictor

üöÄ **NASA Space Apps Challenge ‚Äì Team Jurassic World**

SkyRisk is a **frontend web app** that helps users predict the likelihood of extreme weather conditions at a specific location and date. It combines **historical climatology data** with **short-term weather forecasts** to provide actionable insights for outdoor events like hikes, vacations, or fishing trips.
